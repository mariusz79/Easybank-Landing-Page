## EasyBank Landing Page

> This responsive landing page was build from design provided by [frontmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN).

> Both mobile and desktop version were provided. The designs were in JPG static format. This means 
that I had to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

>JavaScript required was for the mobile navigation toggle.

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
